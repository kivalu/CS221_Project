With over 3 million cases in the United States per year, pneumonia is a dangerous and common lung infection caused by germs, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. While most healthy people recover from pneumonia in one to three weeks, the infection can still be life-threatening. The people most at risk are infants, young children, adults 65 or older, and people who have other health problems. Pneumonia symptoms can vary from mild to severe including chest pain, nausea, fever and shaking chills, and lower than normal body temperature. While these symptoms are helpful, some patients may show no signs of infection. Treating pneumonia as early as possible is vital, especially when dealing with patients that are most at risk. 

With these factors in mind, our project is to train a artificial neural network with deep learning so that when given an x-ray of a chest image we can estimate the probability that the lung has pneumonia. We will train our network with data containing images of normal lungs and lungs with pneumonia. Afterwards, we will test our network on unlabeled images of pneumonia to determine the efficacy of our neural network. Finally, we will use our neural network trained to detect pneumonia, and test it on X-Ray images of lungs with tuberculosis and evaluate how our system can be translated to lung tuberculosis. Our hope is to design a neural network that will be able to confidently detect the presence of infections as early as possible in order for doctors to be able to treat patients immediately, before the infection becomes invasive.
